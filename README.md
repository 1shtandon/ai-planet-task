# Hackathon Submission Site

This is a hackathon submission site, created as a part of an internship assignment. The site allows learners to create, edit, and delete their hackathon submissions. The submissions are stored in the browser's local storage as a database and can be viewed by other learners who visit the site.

## Features

* Learners should be able to create, edit, and delete their submission.
* Every submission form should have the following fields:
  * Title
  * Summary
  * Description
  * Cover Image
  * Hackathon name
  * Hackathon start date
  * Hackathon end date
  * Github repository link
  * Other links (optional)

* Learners should be able to see the list of submissions, where they can search the submission using title.
* Learners should be able to sort the submissions based on the hackathon start date (oldest, newest).


* There should be 2 tabs:
    * All submissions
    * Favourite submissions
* When clicked on a submission, it should take the learner to a page where they can see all the data related to the submission.
* On this page, the learner should be able to edit, delete the submission, and by clicking on the start icon, they can make that submission as their favorite.
* All the favourite submissions should be visible in the favorite tab.


The deployment link is given in the about section.
